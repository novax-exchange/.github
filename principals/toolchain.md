# Don't reinvent the wheel
When designing a solution, don't limit to Build Your Own. Leverage internal and external resources and capability are evenly essential.

# No Excel Swamp
- Data pipeline should be applied to all functional department: Sales, BA, Marketing and all other research analyst.
- Even we are in Excel, use Excel as data tool (data sheet + pivot table)


# Integrate into Code Cycle
This is an execution for API strategy. 
- Document should be part of code cycle
  - Example: Writing markdown code and generate it by Pandoc, it takes Document as artifact of code
  - Example: Writing Google Sheet and [expose it via API](https://blog.coupler.io/how-to-use-google-sheets-as-database/#Exportimport_data_automatically_using_the_Google_Sheets_API), it takes Document as data source of code.

Exception: if it conflicts with principal **Less is preferred**, it overwhelms.

# Deterministic applies, a lot
- artifacts should be transferable, reproducible, readable to achieve maintainable.
