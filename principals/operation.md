# Exclude project mindset
We are a long lasting product team and doing value-based business, there is no delivery or wrap up. 
- Instead we have release(CD) and assertations(CI)

# No upward reporting
It is designed to avoid manipulating, 粉饰太平 or waste time just to satisfy manager.
- Let the data and insight tools tell the status, they should be usable in a level to support self-service enquiry 
- Neither request for report or preparing a report is encouraged
- Stick to single source of truth with guaranteed data lineage.

Upward reporting including town-hall meeting, static BI analytic report, one-off demo per request

# Security is A/B test compliant
If there is no way of being insecure, then there is no security
- If security option is configured as A, then corresponding insecure case should be setup as B option simutanesly. 
- Assertions of both side should appear as a pair.
