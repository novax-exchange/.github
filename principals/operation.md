# Exclude project mindset
We are a long lasting product team and doing value-based business, there is no delivery or wrap up. 
- Instead we have release(CD) and assertations(CI)

# No upward reporting
It is designed to avoid manipulating, 粉饰太平 or waste time just to satisfy manager.
- Let the data and insight tools tell the status, they should be usable in a level to support self-service enquiry 
- Neither request for report or preparing a report is encouraged
- Stick to single source of truth with guaranteed data lineage.

Upward reporting including town-hall meeting, static BI analytic report, one-off demo per request

# IM channel 
- Avoid email as major communication channel.

# Talk with MS 365 is cheap, show me the data and/or code
We still uses MicroSoft 365 as outbound compatible media. But
- It should not work as data exchange media
