# Records management & voting on Mars
The new government of Mars has a records management problem. 
- They have lost track of who was born on Mars and has right of abode.
- They cannot track who has the right to vote, nor can they track the votes made by Martians during elections (they would like to do this in such a way that the voter is not identified, nor is his/her vote made public).
- They also cannot track who owns property on Mars, nor can they track how each property has been bought/sold over time.

Design one or more blockchain solution(s) that helps solve the records management and voting issues that exist on Mars.

Your solution should address the following areas:
1. Trust in the network between the different government departments, the citizens of
Mars, and 3rd parties such as real-estate agents.
2. Discussion on the best solution for the different areas mentioned under 'Background'.
Is blockchain the best solution? What other technology would be suitable? Should the
solution be decentralised or distributed?
3. How can your proposed solution resist security attacks and hacking attempts? What
sort of security attacks are possible against your solution?
4. Explain how we can implement a voting solution without the voters divulging their
identity, their citizenship or their vote?
5. Assume I'm using two different blockchains in my solutions. How can I transfer value
or assets from one blockchain to another?
6. Assume my solution needs to access data from outside of the blockchain network.
How should it access the data and what factors should be considered to ensure data
accuracy and integrity?
7. How will your solution guarantee that every peer node in the blockchain network has
exactly the same data?
8. How would the identities, keys and certificates that belong to the different
organisations in the network be managed and kept secure in your solution?
9. A huge increase in the number of rockets to Mars is leading to a large increase in
traffic. How will your solution scale to handle the increased workload?

## Output
Along with a designated Github repository as POC code base for this solution. You should also produce a technical architecture proposal.
### Proposal
The technical architecture proposal document should not be greater than six pages long, that clearly and succinctly presents an analysis of the requirements and the proposed architecture on Cloud.

Your proposal should include a high-level architecture diagram for this solution. 
- Call out all Cloud services used, the integration between services, and show the data flow between services and components.

Clearly state all assumptions made during the design and explicitly state references used in creation of the document for the client to be able to do further reading.


## Fun fact
This assignment is designed by Michael Edge, the vice Global Blockchain Lead of AWS Profesional Service. 

This is the code test for a Blockchain Architect role at 2019
