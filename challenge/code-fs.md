## Fun fact
Naming: One of my junior alumnus, "God B", the most talented frontend developer I have ever met, invented and resolved this challenge when he was waiting for upcomming interview in a office room.

The initial purpose of this brain training was to warm up his hands as preparation for any code test.

Finally, 30 minutes were spent on complete it as his speed record.

Typically, for other candidates, we can accept 1-2 weeks time spending on it.
